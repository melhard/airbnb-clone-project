## Team Roles

- **Project Manager**: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of the project. Ensures timelines are met and team members collaborate effectively.

- **Product Owner**: Represents the stakeholders and customers. Prioritizes features, writes user stories, and defines the product roadmap.

- **Frontend Developer**: Focuses on the user interface and user experience using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frontend frameworks like React or Vue.js.

- **Backend Developer**: Builds the server-side logic, APIs, and handles database integration and business logic.

- **Full Stack Developer**: Works on both the frontend and backend parts of the application, bridging the gap between both domains.

- **UI/UX Designer**: Designs intuitive user interfaces and optimizes the user experience based on research and feedback.

- **Database Administrator (DBA)**: Manages the database, ensures data integrity, performance, and handles backups and migrations.

- **DevOps Engineer**: Maintains deployment pipelines, infrastructure automation, and monitoring systems for development and production environments.

- **Quality Assurance (QA) Tester**: Tests the application for bugs, usability issues, and ensures the software meets quality standards before release.

- **Security Engineer**: Ensures the application is secure against threats by implementing security best practices and performing vulnerability assessments.

 ## Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend of the application, including RESTful APIs and business logic.

PostgreSQL: An open-source relational database system used to store user data, listings, reservations, and other core entities.

React: A JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces on the frontend.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing responsive and modern user interfaces.

Docker: A platform for containerizing the application to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

## Feature Breakdown

## API Security
 Key Security Measures

1. **Authentication**: Ensures only verified users can access the system (e.g., via JWT or OAuth).
    *Why it matters*: Protects user accounts and prevents unauthorized access to personal data.

2. **Authorization**: Controls what actions users can perform based on roles (e.g., guest vs. host).
    *Why it matters*: Prevents users from accessing or modifying data they shouldn't.

3. **Rate Limiting**: Limits the number of requests from a user or IP.
    *Why it matters*: Protects against abuse, brute-force attacks, and ensures fair usage.

4. **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Cleans and checks all user inputs.
    *Why it matters*: Prevents common attacks like SQL injection and XSS.

5. **Secure Payments**: Uses encrypted protocols and third-party services (e.g., Stripe).
    *Why it matters*: Ensures financial data is handled safely and reduces liability.

## CI/CD Pipeline
**CI/CD pipelines** automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes. They're important because they improve speed, consistency, and reduce errors in software delivery. For this project, CI/CD ensures each update is properly tested and deployed. Tools like **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **Heroku** can be used to set up the pipeline. This helps maintain high code quality and reliable deployments.
